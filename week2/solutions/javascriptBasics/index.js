Task Overview:

Use the following values for comparisons: 5, '5', 10, '10', true, false.
Perform comparisons using both simple and strict equality and inequality operators.
Compare values to determine if they are greater than, less than, greater than or equal to, or less than or equal to each other.
Specific Tasks:

Compare 5 and '5' using simple and strict equality.
Compare 10 and '10' using simple and strict inequality.
Check if 5 is greater than 3 and if '5' is greater than '3'.

Evaluate whether 10 is less than 20 and if '10' is less than '20'.
Determine if 5 is greater than or equal to 5 and if '5' is greater than or equal to 5.
Assess whether 10 is less than or equal to 20 and if '10' is less than or equal to '20'.
Output:

Print each result to the console with a descriptive message, so you know which comparison is being displayed.
